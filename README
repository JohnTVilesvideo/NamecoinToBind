This version has a first support of the new spec (old spec is still supported for a while) :
- https://dot-bit.org/Domain_names


Dependencies :
-------------

- idn	(php5-idn crash with some domain names, so the idn binary is used)

---------

apt-get install idn php5-cli

Copy the file cron/namecoinToBind to /etc/cron.d/

Copy the file config.php.dist to config.php
Edit the file config.php to change at least the namecoin user/pass

Edit the file /etc/bind/named.conf.options and add (adapt it to your needs) :
  // zones generated by the users
  include "/etc/bind/dotbit/bit-forward.conf";
  include "/etc/bind/dotbit/bit-domains.conf";

Create the following folders :
- /etc/bind/dotbit/
